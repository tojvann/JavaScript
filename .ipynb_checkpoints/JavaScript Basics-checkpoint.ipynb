    "- It was created by Brendan Eich in the year 1995 in 10 days\n",
    "- JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript, a standard maintained by the European Computer Manufacturers Association).\n",
    "- JavaScript is primarily a client-side language. A webpage can contain embedded JavaScript, which executes when a user visits the page. The language was created to allow web developers to embed executable code on their webpages, so that they could make their webpages interactive, or perform simple tasks.\n",
    "- JavaScript’s syntax is heavily inspired by C++ and Java. However, the inner workings of JavaScript is closer to a dynamically-typed, interpreted language such as Python or Ruby.\n",
    "- JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. A program such as C++ or Java needs to be compiled before it is run. The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute. In contrast, JavaScript has no compilation step. Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. More modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.\n",
    "- Despite all its faults, JavaScript is a very useful language. JavaScript runs in every web browser, out of the box. A JavaScript application runs on every device,this allows you to write cross-platform apps in a really easy way. JavaScript’s role has also expanded significantly. Platforms such as Node.js allow developers to run JavaScript server-side. It is now possible to create entire web applications in which both client-side and server-side logic is written in JavaScript."
